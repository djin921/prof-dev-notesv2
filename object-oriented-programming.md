# Object Oriented Programming

It is one of *several* modalities you can use to solve problems with code.
C# is big on it, but also has aspects of *imperative* programming, as well as some pretty rad *functional* programming stuff. 

```vb
dim myName as String
set myName = "Jeff"
myName = UCase(myName)

```

```c#
var myName = "Jeff";
myName = myName.ToUpper();
```

## Requirements for being an Object Oriented Language

To be an "object oriented" programming language, the language must support, at a minimum:

1. Encapsulation
    - Making a "capsule" both the data and the code that is most likely to use that data.
2. Polymorphism
3. Inheritance
