# C#

Type of Language:

"Classical Strongly-Typed Object Oriented Language"

- Classical - "Type Based"
    As a developer you break a problem into "categories" (classes) of things.
    Those things have data and code that work on that data.
    The "bringing together" of data and the code that uses that data is called *encapsulation*.
    "State and Behavior" 


## Types in .NET
- Value Types 
- Reference Types - created by using classes.
