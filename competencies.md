## Unconcscious Incompetence
> There are things that you don't know how to do, and you aren't even aware of that yet. (new stuff that sounds important.) Stuff to research or ask about.

- Interface (Still not entirely sure what this is)

## Conscious Incompetence
> There are things you don't know how to do yet, but you know you need to learn it.

- Markdown https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

- Assert.Throws
- Moq
- Effectively using ternary operator for efficiency
- SOLID Principles
- Encapsualtion
- Try, Catch, Finally (Understand how it works but not why/how to implement)
- Integration Tests
- Not entirely sure when to PascalCase vs camelCase (Are variables the only thing that is camelCase for C#?)
    

## Conscious Competence
> There are things that you are pretty good at, but it takes some thought and effort (might need to google a few things)

- C# and .Net's rules and syntax (Both are new Languages for me)

- TDD
- Unit Testing

## Unconscious Competence
> Some things are just second nature for you. They are like "muscle memory" - stuff in this list usually graduates from the Conscious Competence list over time.
- Git
