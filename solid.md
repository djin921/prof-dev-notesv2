# SOLID Principals

(See Steve Smith's pluralsight course as post-class refresher)


## Single Responsibility
Each "code module" (method, class, etc.) should have no more than one thing it does.

## Open Closed
"Code should be closed for modification but open for extension"
Write code so that after it works, you NEVER need to change it.


## Liskov Substitution
## Interface Segregation
## Dependency Inversion
